# Qgis-Flood_tracker-
I am creating a tool for QGIS to automate the flood prediction process

The overall flood risk mapping workflow probably includes steps like:
Collecting DEM (Digital Elevation Model) and rainfall data.
Deriving slope, flow direction, and flow accumulation.
Defining flood zones or hazard areas.
Overlaying with land use/population data.
Producing a flood risk map.
Only one of these steps is automated — the LLM is likely used to interpret or run QGIS commands automatically (maybe through Colab or Python).
Goal: “Fully automate all its steps” and “enhance it to use other flood risk mapping methods".
